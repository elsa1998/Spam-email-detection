# Spam-email-detection
Build deep learning model to determine whether an email is spam or not. Within different methods (Decision tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, LightGBM, and Neutral Network), LightGBM has the best performance in cost-sensitivie and accurate model.

Accuracy: {'Decision Tree': 0.922, 'Logistic Regression': 0.926, 'KNN': 0.895, 'SVM': 0.936, 'LightGBM': 0.952, 'Neural Network': 0.936}

Cost: {'Decision Tree': 377.25, 'Logistic Regression': 391.75, 'KNN': 415.0, 'SVM': 345.5, 'LightGBM': 296.25, 'Neural Network': 409.25}
